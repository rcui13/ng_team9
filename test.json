      "text": "Background: Player, coach, match ball collector and aficionada. Former employee at soccer.com.I've had this ball for almost a year and got it based on the advertising that claims it's a match ball. It is not. It is a decent training ball.What makes this merely a training ball is the suppleness of the ball. There isn't great bounce to this ball and that translates into little explosiveness when coming off your foot. A match ball wraps around your foot and bounces off your foot but this ball feels plasticky like a futsal ball and almost hurts if you kick it as hard as I can because it lacks suppleness. For $26, it's a decent ball. Would I buy another one, no.It's a good value for the money but the claims that it's a match ball are false. Match balls have a stamp of approval from either FIFA or the NFHS.",

They do ship the ball deflated so that it takes up less space, so make sure that you have a ball pump to air it up. That wasn't a big deal for us though since we have multiple pumps.Unfortunately the first time that we tried to air this up it went flat right away after it was filled up. There was a leak on the of the seams of the ball.  We contacted the company right away and they quickly shipped us a new one right away. The replacement arrived very quickly and is working perfectly for him.",

The stitching allows for durability even when the ball has high air pressure. The included pump is a nice little addition. It is small and slick. The way it allows to stow away the needle should keep in from getting bent or broken when not in use. My only complaint for the ball, albeit a very minor one, is the \"FOOTY\" words being so large. It is a little distracting.",
