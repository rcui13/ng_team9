    "text": "\nBackground: Player, coach, match ball collector and aficionada. Former employee at soccer.com.I've had this ball for almost a year and got it based on the advertising that claims it's a match ball. It is not. It is a decent training ball.What makes this merely a training ball is the suppleness of the ball. There isn't great bounce to this ball and that translates into little explosiveness when coming off your foot. A match ball wraps around your foot and bounces off your foot but this ball feels plasticky like a futsal ball and almost hurts if you kick it as hard as I can because it lacks suppleness. For $26, it's a decent ball. Would I buy another one, no.It's a good value for the money but the claims that it's a match ball are false. Match balls have a stamp of approval from either FIFA or the NFHS.\n",
